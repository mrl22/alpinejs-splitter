# TailwindCSS/AlpineJS Laravel Splitter Component

This project consists of two Laravel components that splits content into draggable windows.

There is a component for the horizontal splitter, and another for the vertical splitter.

It currently uses the following NPM packages:

- tailwindcss
- alpinejs
- alpinejs/resize

You can see this project in action at [https://splitter.devfwd.com](https://splitter.devfwd.com).

## Support

I am seeking help and support from others to develop this component further.

This is a feature which I have seen available to react and vue developers, but not to blade/livewire developers.

It must remain simple to use, and not require any additional dependencies.

The license allows you to use this code in your own projects with no restrictions.
